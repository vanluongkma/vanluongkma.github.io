**Pedersen_commitments.py**

```python3

from Crypto.Util.number import getStrongPrime
from Crypto.Random.random import randint

## Implementation of Pedersen Commitment Scheme
## Computationally binding, information theoreticly hiding

# Generate public key for Pedersen Commitments
def gen():
    q = getStrongPrime(1024)
    
    g = randint(1,q-1)
    s = randint(1,q-1)
    h = pow(g,s,q)

    return q,g,h

# Create Pedersen Commitment to message x
def commit(pk, m):
    q, g, h = pk
    r = randint(1,q-1)

    comm = pow(g,m,q) * pow(h,r,q)
    comm %= q

    return comm,r

# Verify Pedersen Commitment to message x, with randomness r
def verify(param, c, r, x):
    q, g, h = param
    if not (x > 1 and x < q):
        return False
    return c == (pow(g,x,q) * pow(h,r,q)) % q
```

Analysis source code

Function **gen()** will produce an output of 3 number $q, g, h$

```python3
def gen():
    q = getStrongPrime(1024)
    
    g = randint(1,q-1)
    s = randint(1,q-1)
    h = pow(g,s,q)

    return q,g,h
```

Function **debug_test** will produce 1 number dbg radom [0, 2**32 - 2]

 ```python3
 def debug_test(pk):
    dbg = randint(0,2**32-2)
    comm, r = commit(pk,dbg)
    return comm, dbg, r
```

Function **commit()** will produce number $$comm = ((g^{dbg} \ mod \ q) * (h^r \ mod \ q)) mod \ q$$


```python3
def commit(pk, m):
    q, g, h = pk
    r = randint(1,q-1)

    comm = pow(g,m,q) * pow(h,r,q)
    comm %= q

    return comm,r
```

With function **main()** we must to send guess so that $$comm = ((g^{guess} \ mod \ q) * (h^r \ mod \ q)) mod \ q$$

and correct 100 times

```python3
for _ in range(1337):
    if correct == 100:
        print("Oh wow, you broke my casino??!? Thanks so much for finding this before launch so i don't lose all my money to cheaters!")
        flag = b"Kalmar{First_Crypto_Down!}"
        print(f"here's that flag you wanted, you earned it! {flag}")
        exit()
    comm, v, r = game(pk)
    print(f'Commitment: {comm}')
    g = input(f'Are you able to guess the value? [Y]es/[N]o')
    if g.lower() == "n":
        print(f'commited value was {v}')
        print(f'randomness used was {r}')
        print(f'verifies = {verif(pk,comm,v,r)}')
    elif g.lower() == "y":
        guess = input(f'whats your guess?')
        if verif(pk, comm, guess, r):
            correct += 1
            print("Oh wow! well done!")
        else:
            print("That's not right... Why are you wasting my time if you haven't broken anything?")
            exit()
```

We have $dbg \in [0, 2**32-2]$ and send input 1337 times, I use module [Rancrack](https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker) or [MT19937 PRNG](https://github.com/kmyk/mersenne-twister-predictor) to solve this problem.

Solution with python language

```python3
from pwn import *
from mt19937predictor import MT19937Predictor

# f = process(["python3", "casino.py"])
f = remote("chal-kalmarc.tf", 9)
f.sendline(b"\n")

MT = MT19937Predictor()

for i in range(624):
	f.sendlineafter(b"[Y]es/[N]o", b"N")
	f.recvuntil(b"commited value was ")
	res = int(f.recvline())
	f.recvuntil(b"\n")
	MT.setrandbits(res, 32)

for i in range(100):
	f.sendlineafter(b"[Y]es/[N]o", b"Y")
	ans = MT.randint(0, 2**32 - 2)
	f.sendline(str(ans).encode())

f.interactive()
```

We can run it locally to speed up this challenge
